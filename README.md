# InsurancePrediction

This project is about training an ML model to predict insurance price based on a few patient properties. 
The data I am working with is from # https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance

The data includes include: age, sex, BMI, children, region, and charges.
The project is split into three parts: examining the data, training the model, and evaluating how well the model did. 

## Examining the Data
First, I need to examine the data to make sure its as fair as possible so theres no bias when training the model. 
Below are some sample images.

This is an image of how the many of each data there are for each category:
